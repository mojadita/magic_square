# MAGIC SQUARE

This code applies the well known formula of an odd sized magic square and
prints it, along with the sums of rows, columns and diagonals to
demonstrate its validity.

This code is recommended for newcomers to C, to learn how to code a
somewhat arbitrary way to fill a square of numbers.
